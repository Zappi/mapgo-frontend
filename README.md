# Mapgo - Draw maps using path finding algorithms

Intermediate studies project: Data structures and algorithms

## Introduction

The target of this project is to provide users a way to draw maps using path finding algorithms. For example, one could draw a map using Dijkstra's or A* algorithm. Map data is provided by OpenStreetMap.

Back end shall be a Node.js application and front end is coded with React. Typescript is used to provide typing on top of JavaScript. This project can be hosted on Heroku if neede.

## Examples of algorithms

- Dijkstra's algorithm
- A*
- DFS

## Examples of data stuctures

- Queue / priority queue
- Fibonacci heap
- Stack
